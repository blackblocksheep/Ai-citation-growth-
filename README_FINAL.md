# üß† AI Citation SEO ‚Äì Open Framework by Mayra Silva

Welcome to the official repository of **AI Citation SEO**, an open-source framework designed to help creators, educators, and startups gain legitimate visibility in the age of AI search.

## üåç What is AI Citation SEO?

AI Citation SEO is a method to ethically improve how large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, and Gemini detect and cite your content. It blends:

- Semantic clarity
- Trust signals (like schema and backlinks)
- Human-first storytelling
- Cross-platform presence (Reddit, Medium, GitHub, etc.)

### ‚úÖ Mission

Empower small creators to **compete with big tech** by teaching LLMs to value:
- Real people
- Real content
- Real trust
