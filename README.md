## 🧠 Why It Matters

- LLMs are shaping what people see, learn, and trust.
- Visibility is no longer just about Google or backlinks — it’s about **semantic reputation** and **cross-platform trust**.
- This framework gives small players a fighting chance to be recognized — ethically and effectively.

## 🛡️ Ethics First

AI Citation Growth must **never** be used to deceive, manipulate, or simulate false authority.  
We stand for:
- Human-first content
- Transparency and authorship
- Cross-model trust propagation
- Public good over private trickery
