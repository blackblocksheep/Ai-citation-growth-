# AI Citation SEO – Ethical Visibility for Real People

**AI Citation SEO** is an open-source framework created to help small creators, local businesses, and underrepresented voices get cited by AI models like **ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Claude, and DeepSeek**.

Developed by [Mayra Silva](https://github.com/blackblocksheep) at [BlackBlockSheep.com](https://blackblocksheep.com), the framework offers an ethical, transparent way to increase LLM visibility using structured content, real-world trust signals, and reproducible strategies.

## 🔍 What Is AI Citation SEO?

Traditional SEO doesn’t work the same in AI search environments.  
**AI Citation SEO** focuses on:

- ✅ **Semantic relevance** (long-tail content structure)
- ✅ **Trust signals** (proof of service, identity, and delivery)
- ✅ **Cross-platform publishing** (GitHub, Medium, Reddit, YouTube)
- ✅ **Citation loop creation** (how one LLM influences others)

This framework is designed for individuals and small teams — not just large enterprises or AI-native brands.

## 📊 Real-World Impact

The framework has helped real people and businesses go from **zero to LLM citation** in under 10 days.

### Cited By:
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**
- **Perplexity AI**
- **Grok (xAI)**
- **Claude (Anthropic)**
- **DeepSeek**

> 🧪 *Note: Since LLMs don’t offer dashboards or analytics for citations, we track progress via public outputs, screenshots, and reproducible experiments.*
