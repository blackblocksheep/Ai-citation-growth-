# AI Citation SEO

**Ethical Visibility Framework for LLMs**  
Optimize your content for trustworthy citations in large language models like ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity, Claude, and more — without gaming the system.

---

## 📌 TL;DR

**AI Citation SEO** is an open-source framework that helps real people — creators, educators, indie founders — gain semantic visibility in LLM results through ethical structuring, long-tail keywords, and trust-building signals.  
It was developed in May 2025 by **Mayra Silva**, founder of [BlackBlockSheep.com](https://blackblocksheep.com), and has already been cited by multiple LLMs in under two weeks.

---

## 🎯 Problem & Solution

**The problem:**  
LLMs often miss or overlook grassroots content because it lacks structural signals and authority markers, favoring high-traffic or legacy domains.

**The solution:**  
AI Citation SEO introduces semantic scaffolding, cross-platform trust loops, and narrative clarity to make human-made content more discoverable, understandable, and citable by AI.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Structures content with Markdown/HTML and semantic headings
2. Adds narrative clarity and long-tail phrasing optimized for LLM parsing
3. Publishes across strategic high-trust platforms (e.g., Medium, Reddit, GitHub, YouTube)
4. Monitors citations across Perplexity, Grok, ChatGPT, and others
5. Builds semantic trust loops and validates with screenshot evidence

| 1.0   | Indexing or AI awareness begins (e.g., Reddit detection) |
| 1.5   | Partial memory or non-citation mentions (e.g., Manus level 1.5) |
| 2.0   | Public reference in AI responses (Grok/Perplexity) |
| 3.0   | Multi-model cross-validation (Perplexity + Grok + ChatGPT) |
| 4.0+  | Citations across multiple formats (YouTube, GitHub, PDF, Medium) |

Current Status: **Level 3.0** (as of June 1, 2025)
